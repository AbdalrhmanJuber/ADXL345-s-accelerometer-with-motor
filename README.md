Motor Control Using ADXL345 Accelerometer and Encoder

This project demonstrates how to control a motor's position so that it matches the tilt angle read from the ADXL345 accelerometer. The motor position is tracked using an encoder, and the system ensures that the motor rotates to align with the desired tilt angle.
